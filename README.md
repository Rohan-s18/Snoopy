# Snoopy
## Author: Rohan Singh
Repository for my own mathematical scripting language "Snoopy". This scripting language is currently under development and I'll be pushing to this repository until it becomes a full-fledged scripting language at the level of Python, R, Matlab etcetera. Snoopy has two components, its shell and its script interpreter, similar to most statistical and mathematical programming languages.  

The src folder contains the source code for the shell and interpreter and the bin folder contains the executibles for the shell and interpreter.  

**This is an open-source project so please free to fork it if you want :)** 

This language is currently under development by the CWRU low-level programming club :)
