# Snoopy
## Author: Rohan Singh
Repository for my own mathematical scripting language "Snoopy". This scripting language is currently under development and I'll be pushing to this repository until it becomes a full-fledged scripting language at the level of Python, R, Matlab etcetera. This is currently a personal project, but feel free to fork it if you want.
